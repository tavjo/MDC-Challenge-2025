I am running into an error with my code that I need your help with. Please go through a systematic troubleshooting process during which you will:

1) examine what went wrong 
2) summarize the error
3) Come up with 5 differential diagnoses
4) Iteratively eliminate diagnoses until you are left with one. Be sure to provide evidence and justification for why you believe each diagnosis is no longer plausible
5) Propose up to 3 *well-informed* options for how to solve the problem

You should wait for my input on your analysis of the problem prior to attempting to make any changes to the codebase.
